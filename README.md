## How to Play
### Game Rules
The goal is to be the first player to reach 10 victory points. Players earn points by building settlements, cities, having the largest army and getting victory points from development cards.

1. **Setup:** Each player starts with 2 settlements and 2 roads. Players take turns to place their initial settlements and roads.
2. **Turn Sequence:**
    * *Roll Dice:* The active player rolls two dice to determine resource production for all players.
    * *Resource Collection:* Each player collects resources from their settlements and cities adjacent to the rolled number.
    * *Trade:* Players can trade resources with each other or four cards of the same resource for one.
    * *Build:* Players can build roads, settlements, cities, or buy development cards using their resources.
    * *Play Development Cards:* Players can play one development card per turn.
    * *End Turn:* The turn passes to the next player.
3. **Winning the Game:** The first player to reach 10 points wins the game.

### Player Actions
1. **Build Road:** Connects two intersections and is required for expanding your reach on the board. Requirements: 1 wood and 1 brick.
2. **Build Settlement:** Collects resources from adjacent tiles and earns 1 victory point. Requirements: 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, and 1 sheep.
3. **Build City:** Upgrades a settlement to a city, doubling resource production from adjacent tiles and earns 2 victory points. Requirements: 3 ore and 2 wheat
4. **Buy Development Card:** Provides special abilities such as building additional roads, gaining resources, or earning victory points. Requirements: 1 ore, 1 wheat, and 1 sheep.

## Running the Code
To compile the project, use the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
make
```
This command will compile all necessary files and generate the executable for the Catan game, which includes compiling the main program (`demo`) and tests (`test`).

```sh
make catan
```
This command will compile the main program (`demo`) and then runs it (`./demo`).

## Classes Overview
This project consists of various classes that help implement the game. Some classes represent different pieces of the game, such as Board and DevelopmentCard, while others handle the game logic, like Catan and Player.

## Class Details

## Tests
This project includes comprehensive unit tests using the `doctest.h` framework. These tests cover initialization, game rules, player actions, resource management, and edge cases to ensure the robustness and correctness of the implementation.

To run the tests:
```sh
make test
```
```sh
./test
```
This command compiles the test program (`test`). After compiling, running `./test` will execute the test suite.
